# File Transfer Protocol (FTP)


It was my End semester project i.e. creating this FTP having a user interface in Java. It simply sends file from Client to Server but not the other way around. Obviously you can do that as well. Plus, there are a lot of exceptions to handle which can also be done. I just did my part ;p

# Screen Shots
Below are Screen shots of Server and Client Side user interface.

## Server Side
<img src="/ss/server.PNG" height = 400>

## Client Side
<img src="/ss/client.PNG" height = 400>

# Instructions

I code the GUI using Design panel in Eclipse that's why you might need <b>Eclipse</b> to use the design page otherwise if you know the java gui stuff like swing etc. then there's no need.

First, compile and run the Server side using:

```javac FTP_Server.java```

```java FTP_Server.java```

Then, compile and run the Client side using:

```javac FTP_Client.java```

```java FTP_Client.java```

Other than these commands you can simply run the Serve side and client side using a 'Play' button in IDEs. <b>But, make sure to run Server first and the Client.</b>
